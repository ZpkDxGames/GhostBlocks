# GhostBlocks Plugin

- A Minecraft plugin that creates ghost blocks - blocks that are visible but doesn't have a hitbox.
- **Build errors**: Ensure you have Java 17+ and Maven 3.6+ installed

## Features

### üéÆ Core Functionality
- **Ghost Blocks**: Create blocks that are visible but have no collision/hitbox
- **Categorized GUI**: Organized block selection with 4 categories (Building, Nature, Redstone, Decoration)
- **Pagination System**: Navigate through multiple pages of blocks in each category
- **Ghost Block Remover**: Special tool to remove ghost blocks by looking at them and right-clicking
- **Auto-Save System**: Ghost blocks persist across server restarts and reloads

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features
- Uses FallingBlock entities with disabled gravity and decay
- Concurrent data structures for thread-safe operations
- YAML-based persistence storage
- Location-based ghost block mapping for efficient lookups
- Improved ghost block removal with line-of-sight detection
- Categorized and paginated GUI system
- Admin commands for maintenance and debugging

## Installation

1. Download the plugin JAR file
2. Place it in your server's `plugins/` directory
3. Restart your server
4. The plugin will create a `ghostblocks.yml` configuration file automatically

## Commands

| Command | Description | Permission |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/ghostblocks` | Open the ghost blocks GUI | `ghostblocks.use` |
| `/ghostblocks help` | Show help information | `ghostblocks.use` |
| `/ghostblocks count` | Show number of ghost blocks | `ghostblocks.use` |
| `/ghostblocks manage` | Open the ghost block management GUI | `ghostblocks.use` |
| `/ghostblocks remover` | Get the ghost block remover tool | `ghostblocks.use` |
| `/ghostblocks reload` | Reload the plugin | `ghostblocks.admin` |
| `/ghostblocks cleanup` | Clean up invalid ghost blocks | `ghostblocks.admin` |

**Aliases:** `/gb`, `/ghost`

## Permissions

- `ghostblocks.use` - Allows using the plugin (default: true)
- `ghostblocks.admin` - Allows administrative functions (default: op)

## How to Use

1. **Getting Ghost Blocks:**
   - Use `/ghostblocks` to open the categorized GUI
   - Click on category buttons (Building, Nature, Redstone, Decoration) to switch categories
   - Use Previous/Next Page buttons to navigate through pages
   - Click on any block to get it as a ghost block item
   - Click on the "Ghost Block Remover" to get the removal tool

2. **Placing Ghost Blocks:**
   - Place ghost block items like normal blocks
   - They will automatically become ghost blocks (visible but no hitbox)

3. **Removing Ghost Blocks:**
   - Hold the Ghost Block Remover (stick) and look at a ghost block
   - Right-click while looking at the ghost block to remove it
   - The tool will find ghost blocks within your line of sight

## Block Categories

### üèóÔ∏è Building Blocks
- Stone variants (Stone, Cobblestone, Stone Bricks, etc.)
- Deepslate variants (Deepslate, Cobbled Deepslate, etc.)
- Sandstone variants (Sandstone, Red Sandstone, etc.)
- Blackstone variants (Blackstone, Polished Blackstone, etc.)
- Prismarine variants and more

### üå≤ Nature Blocks
- All wood types (Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Acacia, Dark Oak, Mangrove, Cherry, Bamboo)
- Stripped wood variants
- Ground blocks (Dirt, Grass, Podzol, Mycelium, etc.)
- Ice blocks (Ice, Packed Ice, Blue Ice)
- Natural stone (Calcite, Tuff, Dripstone Block)

### ‚ö° Redstone Blocks
- Redstone components (Redstone Block, Observer, Dispenser, etc.)
- Copper blocks in all oxidation states
- Functional blocks (Furnace, Crafting Table, Smithing Table, etc.)
- Mechanical blocks (Piston, Sticky Piston, etc.)

### üé® Decoration Blocks
- All concrete colors and concrete powder
- All terracotta colors and glazed terracotta
- Nether blocks (Netherrack, Nether Bricks, etc.)
- End blocks (End Stone, Purpur Block, etc.)
- Precious blocks (Diamond Block, Gold Block, etc.)
- Special blocks (Amethyst, Sculk, Ancient Debris, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Ghost Block Implementation
- Ghost blocks are implemented using FallingBlock entities
- Properties set: `gravity=false`, `dropItem=false`, `hurtEntities=false`
- Positioned at block center with 0.5 offset for perfect alignment
- Persistent across server restarts via YAML storage

### Data Storage
- Ghost blocks are saved to `plugins/GhostBlocks/ghostblocks.yml`
- Automatic save on server shutdown
- Automatic load on server startup
- Includes world name, coordinates, material, and unique ID

### Performance Considerations
- Uses ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations
- Location-based indexing for O(1) ghost block lookups
- Cleanup system to remove invalid ghost blocks
- Minimal impact on server performance

## Building from Source

### Requirements
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Paper 1.20.6 API or higher

### Build Steps
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd GhostBlocks
mvn clean package
```

The compiled JAR will be in the `target/` directory.

## Configuration

The plugin automatically creates a `ghostblocks.yml` file in the plugin directory. This file stores all ghost block data and should not be manually edited.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Ghost blocks not persisting**: Check that the plugin has write permissions to the plugin directory
2. **Ghost blocks appearing as normal blocks**: Ensure you're using Paper 1.20.4 and not Bukkit/Spigot
3. **Can't remove ghost blocks**: Make sure you're looking directly at the ghost block and using the Ghost Block Remover tool
4. **Build errors**: Ensure you have Java 17+ and Maven 3.6+ installed
5. **GUI not opening**: Check that you have the `ghostblocks.use` permission

### Debug Commands
- Use `/ghostblocks count` to see how many ghost blocks are loaded
- Use `/ghostblocks cleanup` to remove any invalid ghost blocks
- Check the server console for any error messages
